    <h1>Privacy Policy for BlurBucha</h1>
    
    <p>Last updated: [Insert Date]</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for using BlurBucha! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome extension.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>BlurBucha does not collect, store, or share any personal information. The extension functions locally on your device and does not transmit any data to external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>BlurBucha requires the following permissions to function properly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> This permission is used to allow the extension to interact with the active tab when you click on the extension icon. It enables BlurBucha to blur, hide, or modify chat history content only when you choose to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>Host Permissions:</strong> The extension requires access to specific sites, such as <code>https://chatgpt.com/*</code>, to apply its functionalities. These permissions are strictly limited to applying the chat visibility controls on these sites.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Since BlurBucha does not collect any personal information, there is no information to use or share. The extension solely operates within your browser to provide chat history visibility options.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize your privacy and security. BlurBucha operates entirely within your local browser environment and does not transmit any data to third-party servers. This ensures that your chat content and browsing activities remain private and secure.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
